# Laravel Tutorial


## Routes
In Laravel, all routes are defined in the `routes/web.php` file for web interfaces or `routes/api.php` for API routes.
## Router Methods
```php
Route::get($uri, $callback);
Route::post($uri, $callback);
Route::put($uri, $callback);
Route::patch($uri, $callback);
Route::delete($uri, $callback);
Route::options($uri, $callback);
Route::view($uri, $view, $data = []);
Route::redirect($from, $to, $status = 302);
```
You can also group routes or apply middleware:
```php
Route::middleware(['auth'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard', function () {
        // Only authenticated users may access this route...
    });
});
```


## Views
Views are stored in the `resources/views` directory.
To return a view from a route or controller:
```php
return view('welcome'); // resources/views/welcome.blade.php
```
### Passing Data to Views
You can pass data to a view in several ways:
```php
return view('profile', ['name' => 'Taylor']); // fixed value

return view('profile', ['name' => $name]); // varible

return view('profile', compact('name')); // if both values (varible and datavalue have the same name
```
Example Blade File (resources/views/profile.blade.php)
```php
<h1>Hello, {{ $name }}</h1>
```
Blade is Laravelâ€™s templating engine. You can use directives like:
```php
@if ($user)
    Hello, {{ $user->name }}
@endif
```
This section will soon be continued with loops, conditionals, layouts (`@extends`, `@section`, `@yield`) and componentsa


## Controllers
Create a controller using Artisan:
```
php artisan make:controller UserController
```
